# cs441-gryoscope_pong-android

This is an Android app that is a twist on the classic game, Pong. The user moves their paddle by turning their phone.

## to do
- AIPaddle class that inherits from Paddle?
- fix prepareForVolley, it shouldn't use ball, need left vs right, maybe put in game
- you should probably use move by pitch in game class as well
- clean and comment game code
- possibly reuse fonts and buttons via MainClass
- make speed a function of screen size?
- bug test game
